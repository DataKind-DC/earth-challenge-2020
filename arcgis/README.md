# Using the Python API for ArcGIS

To work with ArcGIS within Jupyter notebook:
1) Make sure you have Conda installed: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#macos
2) `conda install -c esri arcgis`
3) Try running `jupyter notebook` from within the `earth-challenge-2020 > arcgis` folder
4) Run the first block of `starter_shell.ipynb` and see if you can see a map!
